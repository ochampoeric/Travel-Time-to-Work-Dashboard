# Travel-Time-to-Work-Dashboard
## Purpose
Two things led to the idea for this project: jury duty and the amount of time it took to get there! Los Angeles has two periods in which traffic is excruciating, day and night. "Gee... It's bad enough jury duty starts at 9. Everyone on their way to work, stuck in traffic, have it better." I thought. It got me to think that if I were to escape egregious LA traffic, I would need to find a new home where traveling to work ain't so bad. With an empty LinkedIn project section gouging me of professional vibrancy, I came across a dataset to be used for a potential portfolio project. I was looking to determine the best place to live where I wouldn't spend half of the day traveling to work! To begin, I developed a dashboard to help me and others find areas that meet their preferences.
## Navigating the *Repository*
I have included the links to the datasets I used for this project: [Travel Time to Work Dataset](https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::travel-time-to-work/about) and [Means of Transportation to Work](https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::means-of-transportation-to-work/about).

And if you happened to stumble on my project (not through LinkedIn at least) here is a hyperlink to my [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/TravelTimeTransportDashboard/FinalBoard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)!
