# Travel-Time-to-Work-Dashboard
## Purpose
Two things led to the idea for this project: jury duty and the amount of time it took to get there! Los Angeles has two periods in which traffic is excruciating, day and night. "Gee... It's bad enough that jury duty starts at 9. Everyone on their way to work, stuck in traffic, have it better." I thought. It got me thinking that if I were to escape egregious LA traffic, I would need to find a new home where traveling to work isn't so bad. With an empty LinkedIn project section depriving me of professional vibrancy, I came across a dataset I would like to use for a potential portfolio project. I want to determine the best place to live so that I don't have to spend half of the day traveling to work! I developed a Tableau dashboard to answer my questions and help others find areas that meet their traveling preferences.
## Navigating the *Repository*
Here are the links to the datasets I used for this project: [Travel Time to Work Dataset](https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::travel-time-to-work/about) and [Means of Transportation to Work](https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::means-of-transportation-to-work/about).

If you are interested, check out the MySQL code that lead to the results used in the tableau dashboard [HERE](Travel_Time_to_Work_Code.sql) .

And if you happened to stumble on my project (not through LinkedIn at least) here is my [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/TravelTimeTransportDashboard/FinalBoard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)!
